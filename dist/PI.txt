This 37-years-old female patient had past history of hypertension and obesity (103 kgs decreased to 73 kgs in 2 years) but denied any other systemic diseases. According to the patient, she has had hypertension for 5–6 years. Although with regular medical control, her blood pressure was still around 130–140 mmHg. Under the suspicion of secondary hypertension, kidney echo was arranged on 2015/05/26 and showed a 2.5cm right renal tumor (Fig. 1a). She had no fever, hematuria, flank pain nor loss of body weight. Urine analysis revealed no positive finding. Abdominal CT showed a nearly 3 cm mild contrast enhancing mass lesion in right renal sinus (Fig. 1). CT guided biopsy reported an epithelial neoplasm with neuroendocrine features. After discussion with the patient, right radical nephrectomy was performed on 2015/8/13. Pathology reported a primary carcinoid tumor about 2.4 × 2.3 × 2.1 cm in size (Fig. 1b) and consisted of trabecular or ribbon-like arrangement of monotonous tumor cells with oval nuclear and salt-and-pepper chromatin (Fig. 2). Immunohistologically, the tumor cells were positive for Synaptophysin and CD56, the level of proliferation marker Ki-67 was <2% (Fig. 3). She recovered smoothly and was discharged on 8th post-operation day. There was no evidence of metastasis and the hypertension was under better control during the 10 months follow-up period.


A 48-year-old man was first seen by a rheumatologist in the beginning of 2011 because of progressing weakness, 10 kg weight loss during the recent year, diminishing height and muscular and bone pain in arms, lower back and chest which severely limited his movements. The patient felt unhealthy since 2009; however, his life history had no recorded health-related problems except for rib fracture during a car accident in his childhood and many years of smoking. His family history revealed that his father died of pancreatic cancer, his brother died of oncohematology condition and his mother lives with oncohematological disease. At the time of investigation, he was 180 cm tall (being 184 cm when healthy) and weighted 73 kg (BMI = 22.5 kg/m2). Physical examination revealed scoliosis and kyphosis of the spine, overall weakness, weakness in muscles and pain in both arms when palpating. The laboratory investigations showed no inflammation, and the only abnormality in serological readings was elevated alkaline phosphatase—248 U/l (normal values, 40–150) due to its bone-specific fraction comprising 80.5 % (Table 1). The radiology of the spine revealed compressive fracture in Th11–Th12, which was confirmed by the following computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) readings as well. Bone mineral density was 0.840 g/cm2 indicating osteopenia. Because of the family history, the patient underwent urological examination and ultrasound of the thyroid gland, liver, spleen and prostate. His lung CT scan was inconspicuous with small atelectasis in lower segments. He was also referred to a haematologist and endocrinologist, but after examination, both myeloma and parathyroid disease were excluded, although autoimmune thyroiditis due to raised autoantibodies against thyroid tissue was diagnosed. No treatment except for painkillers was prescribed.
